## Reporting a Vulnerability

No, but seriously. I do not expect to keep versioning in this repo...
But if you find any issues or security vulnerability please create an issue [here](https://github.com/NoNameForMee/simple_scripts/issues/new/choose) on Github and I will try to correct it as soon as possible.
